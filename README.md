Currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Statistics at Yildiz Technical University, I have developed a solid foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling through coursework. My coursework in statistics, including SQL, Python, regression, optimization, hypothesis testing, has equipped me with the technical skills necessary for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. As a highly motivated and detail-oriented person, I also took courses on DataCamp to expand my knowledge in data analysis, including Python and SQL.
